```

## 📘 API Reference
This project does not include a backend API. However, if you intend to integrate one, consider the following structure:

### Add to Cart API
- **Endpoint**: `/api/cart`
- **Method**: `POST`
- **Parameters**:
  - `productId`: ID of the product to add.
  - `quantity`: Number of items to add.
- **Returns**: Updated cart object.

```json
{
  "productId": "123",
  "quantity": 2
}
```

## 🧩 Architecture
The project follows a simple architecture, primarily consisting of HTML files for different views. Below is a basic representation of the structure:

```
